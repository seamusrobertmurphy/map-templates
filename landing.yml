  description: >
    Climate maps featuring mean daily temperature (°C), precipitation (mm³/day), relative humidity (%), 
    and wind speed (m/s) derived from Environment and Climate Change Canada weather station data using Inverse 
    Distance Weighting interpolation. Station data aggregated over specified periods and spatially interpolated 
    to continuous raster surfaces, supporting wildfire risk assessment, agricultural planning, environmental 
    monitoring, and climate impact studies for operational decision-making.
